            <h2>About Michelle</h2>
            <div class="img-yoga-teacher"></div>
            <p>I am a dedicated yoga instructor, wellness enthusiast, and devoted mamma of two. However, I wasn't always a yogi and wellness devotee. Luckily I was introduced to yoga by another curious soul in 2011. The practice of yoga quickly began benefiting me, and I experienced a profound shift inside of my mind, body and spirit. As my passion grew, I felt compelled to share my newfound knowledge and skill so that others might experience positive results in their own lives. Today, I continue to be a curious seeker, always striving to learn more... and more! </p>
            <p>Yoga is not just doing a few poses once you've rolled out your mat. It is a way of life. It encompasses a variety of practices you can do sitting quietly at your desk or even when teaching a child a life skill. Yoga is a practice of love that welcomes us to turn inward while seeking connections with others, as well as ourselves. I invite you to practice with me... to begin your own journey.</p>
